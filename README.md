movie trailer project 
I Lokesh Krishna done this project first by downloading a file in udacity classroom after that I saved the same file with with extention .py and that too with same name as freshtomatoes and after that created an file  media.py that contains about what the properties of a movie are that need to be encapsulated in a movie object such as movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. Look at what open_movies_page() does with a list of movie objects for hints on how to design your movie class.
And afer that i created that entertainment_center.py by calling the constructor media.Movie() to instantiate movie objects. Iâ€™ve given movies their own custom data structure by defining the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can be stored in a list data structure. This list of movies is what the open_movies_page() function needs as input in order to build the HTML file, so you can display your web
After that when you run the python files an web page opens and shows list of movies when you click on anyone it will show you the trailer of specified movie.
